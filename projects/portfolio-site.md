The responsive portfolio site you are currently visiting. This site is a React app built with Next.js and enhanced with the elegance of Styled Components. During its creation, I delved into the powerful features of Next.js, expanding my knowledge of the framework. I also incorporated CSS animations to elevate the user experience, making this website a dynamic showcase of my skills and creativity.
